            <p class="lead">Hackers don't usually "hack" passwords in the way you see in movies (typing furiously at a green screen). They exploit human laziness and predictability. Here are the top 5 mistakes that open the door to them.</p>

            <h2>1. Password Reuse (The Cardinal Sin)</h2>
            <p>This is the #1 cause of major breaches. You use the same password for your Netflix account as you do for your bank.</p>
            <p><strong>The Scenario:</strong> A low-security forum you joined 5 years ago gets hacked. Your email and password are leaked to the Dark Web. Hackers then use "Credential Stuffing" bots to try that email/password combination on Amazon, PayPal, Gmail, and thousands of other sites. If you reused the password, they are in.</p>

            <h2>2. Using Personal Information</h2>
            <p>Social Engineering is the art of manipulating people into giving up confidential info. But often, you give it up voluntarily on social media.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your dog's name? It's on your Instagram.</li>
                <li>Your birth year? It's on Facebook.</li>
                <li>Your favorite team? It's in your Twitter bio.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Hackers use "wordlists" tailored to you. If your password is <code>Rover1995</code>, it will be guessed in seconds.</p>

            <h2>3. Pattern usage (Keyboard Walks)</h2>
            <p>Passwords like <code>qwerty</code>, <code>123456</code>, or <code>qazwsx</code> (walking down the left side of the keyboard) are the first strings checked by brute-force software.</p>

            <h2>4. Thinking "Substitutions" Are Clever</h2>
            <p>Replacing 'a' with '@' or 'i' with '1' is called "Leet Speak." It was clever in 1990. Today, every cracking rule-set accounts for these substitutions automatically. <code>P@$$w0rd</code> is statistically just as weak as <code>password</code> to a computer.</p>

            <h2>5. Ignoring Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</h2>
            <p>Even the strongest password can be phished. 2FA acts as a safety net. If you don't have 2FA enabled, your password is your single point of failure. Always enable SMS or App-based (Google Authenticator) 2FA.</p>
