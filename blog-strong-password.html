            <p class="lead">The advice you heard ten years ago—"replace E with 3 and A with @"—is dead. Modern cracking tools are smarter than that. Here is the modern, mathematical approach to securing your digital life.</p>

            <h2>The Death of Complexity, The Rise of Length</h2>
            <p>For years, IT departments forced us to create passwords like <code>Tr0ub4dor&3</code>. They were hard to type, hard to remember, and surprisingly easy for computers to guess. This is because humans are predictable. When asked to use a special character, most people use an exclamation mark at the end.</p>
            <p><strong>The new standard is Entropy.</strong></p>
            <p>Entropy is a measure of randomness. The math is simple: a longer password, even with simpler characters, often has higher entropy (and thus takes longer to crack) than a short, complex one.</p>

            <h3>The Passphrase Method</h3>
            <p>Instead of a random string of characters, use a "Passphrase." This is a string of 4-5 random words strung together.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Weak:</strong> <code>P@ssw0rd1!</code> (Cracked instantly)</li>
                <li><strong>Strong:</strong> <code>battery horse staple correct</code> (Cracked in centuries)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This concept, popularized by the webcomic XKCD, works because the length creates a massive search space for the hacker.</p>

            <h2>Step-by-Step Guide to the Perfect Password</h2>
            
            <h3>1. Aim for 16 Characters or More</h3>
            <p>Size matters. Every character you add increases the difficulty exponentially. A 12-character password is the bare minimum in 2026, but 16+ is the gold standard.</p>

            <h3>2. Mix Your Character Sets</h3>
            <p>While length is king, variety is queen. Use:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Lowercase letters (a-z)</li>
                <li>Uppercase letters (A-Z)</li>
                <li>Numbers (0-9)</li>
                <li>Symbols (!@#$)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Avoid "Dictionary" Words (Unless Chained)</h3>
            <p>A single dictionary word like "Sunflower" can be guessed instantly by a dictionary attack. However, "Sunflower" combined with "Tractor" and "Galaxy" becomes exponentially harder because the computer has to guess the combination of words, not just one.</p>

            <h2>Why You Should Use a Password Manager</h2>
            <p>The human brain is not designed to remember 50 unique, 20-character passwords. We strongly recommend using a Password Manager (like Bitwarden, 1Password, or LastPass). These tools generate cryptographically random passwords for you and store them in an encrypted vault.</p>
            <p>If you use a manager, you only need to create <strong>one</strong> incredibly strong Master Password (using the passphrase method above) to unlock the rest.</p>
