            <p>
                SecurePass Check was founded with a simple yet ambitious goal: to make the internet a safer place, one password at a time. We recognized a significant gap in the digital landscape. Cybersecurity tools were often too complex for the average user, riddled with technical jargon, or worst of all, insecure themselves (requiring users to submit data to remote servers).
            </p>
            <p>
                We believe that safety is a right, not a luxury. Whether you are a college student protecting your thesis, a senior citizen securing your retirement account, or a small business owner safeguarding client data, you deserve access to professional-grade security analysis without the barrier to entry.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Privacy by Design</h2>
            <p>
                Trust is the currency of the internet, and we treat it with the utmost respect. SecurePass Check was architected with a <strong>"Privacy First"</strong> philosophy. Unlike many other free tools on the web, we do not store, log, or transmit your data.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our tool runs entirely on <strong>Client-Side JavaScript</strong>. This means the code that analyzes your password is downloaded to your browser and executed locally on your device. Your secret password never travels across the internet to our servers. We cannot see it, store it, or share it, because we never receive it. This architecture allows you to use our tool with complete peace of mind, and even verify its safety by running it while disconnected from the internet.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Educational Focus</h2>
            <p>
                We are more than just a calculator. We are an educational resource. A "Red" or "Green" light is not enough; users need to understand <em>why</em> a password is weak. That is why we provide detailed breakdowns, time-to-crack estimates, and a comprehensive library of articles covering topics from Two-Factor Authentication to the psychology of social engineering. We aim to empower our users with the knowledge they need to navigate the digital world safely.
