        <h2>1. Zero-Knowledge Architecture</h2>
        <p><strong>SecurePass Check is a client-side application.</strong> This is the most important part of our policy. When you type a password into the input field on our homepage, the analysis code runs inside your web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.). <strong>Your password data is never sent to our servers, is never stored in a database, and is never seen by the website owners.</strong></p>

        <h2>2. Data Collection</h2>
        <p>While we do not collect your passwords, we use third-party tools to maintain the website:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Log Files:</strong> Like many other websites, we utilize log files. The information inside the log files includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), date/time stamp, referring/exit pages, and number of clicks. This information is not linked to any information that is personally identifiable.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Google AdSense & DoubleClick DART Cookie</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Third party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on a user's prior visits to your website or other websites.</li>
            <li>Google's use of advertising cookies enables it and its partners to serve ads to your users based on their visit to your sites and/or other sites on the Internet.</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>4. Links to External Sites</h2>
