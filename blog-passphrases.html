            <p class="lead">The traditional password advice was to create complex gibberish. The modern advice is to create a "Passphrase"—a sentence or collection of words. Why the shift?</p>

            <h2>The Problem with Complexity</h2>
            <p>Humans are bad at randomness. When asked to create a complex password, we make predictable choices:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Capitalizing the first letter.</li>
                <li>Adding a "1" or "!" at the end.</li>
                <li>Replacing "a" with "@".</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A computer can guess these patterns very quickly. Furthermore, strings like <code>J8#kL2!m</code> are impossible to remember, forcing users to write them down (unsafe) or reset them constantly (annoying).</p>

            <h2>Enter the Passphrase</h2>
            <p>A passphrase is a sequence of random words. For example:</p>
            <blockquote>purple-bicycle-eating-pizza</blockquote>
            <p><strong>Why is this stronger?</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Length:</strong> This phrase is 27 characters long. The math of entropy heavily favors length. Even without numbers or symbols, a 27-character string is virtually unbreakable by brute force.</li>
                <li><strong>Memorability:</strong> It is easy for a human brain to visualize a purple bicycle eating pizza. It is hard to visualize <code>J8#kL2!m</code>.</li>
                <li><strong>Typing Speed:</strong> It is much faster to type words you know than to hunt for special symbols on your keyboard.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>How to Build a Good Passphrase</h2>
            <p><strong>Do:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use 4 or more random, unrelated words.</li>
                <li>Separate them with spaces or dashes.</li>
                <li>Add one capital letter or number if the website requires it (e.g., <code>Purple-bicycle-eating-pizza1</code>).</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Don't:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use common sayings or lyrics (e.g., "To be or not to be"). Hackers have lists of these.</li>
                <li>Use names of family members or pets.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The XKCD Method</h3>
            <p>This concept was famously illustrated by the webcomic XKCD, which showed that <code>correcthorsebatterystaple</code> took 550 years to crack, while <code>Tr0ub4dor&3</code> took 3 days. The logic holds up: mathematical difficulty for computers, ease of memory for humans.</p>
