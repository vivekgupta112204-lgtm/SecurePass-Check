        <h2>Educational Tool</h2>
        <p>The Password Strength Checker tool is a mathematical estimator. It calculates theoretical strength based on character combinations and standard entropy formulas. It does not test against real-world databases of leaked passwords, nor does it guarantee protection against phishing, malware, keylogging, or social engineering attacks.</p>
        <p>A "Strong" rating on this site means the password is mathematically difficult to guess via brute force. It does not guarantee that the password is safe if you have used it on a compromised website or shared it with others.</p>
